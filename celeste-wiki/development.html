    <h1>About the developers</h1>
    <p>The developers of Celeste are Extremly OK Games, Ltd</p>
    <p>They have also made other games like Towerfall and as of recently</p>
    <p>they made the game Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain</p>
    <h2>How was Celeste made?</h2>
    <p>The development of Celeste started all the way back in 2015</p>
    <p>when the game developers Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry participated</p>
    <p>in a game jam. There they created a version of Celeste for the PICO-8.</p>
    <p>They then wanted to expand it into a full game. Being inspired by</p>
    <p>Thorson's previous game Towerfall and Super Mario Bros. 3 they made</p>
    <p>the gameplay minimal and made it mirror the feeling of rock climbing</p>
    <p>They made Celeste to be accessible, featuring an assist mode to make</p>
    <p>the game more forgiving and less challenging. In order to create</p>
    <p>a more "introspective" game, the developers added themes</p>
    <p>of self-forgiveness into the narrative, which grew to become</p>
    <p>intertwined with the gameplay.</p>
