        <p>with the dash maneuver and introducing both normal and winged strawberries. It also introduces several objects to</p>
        <p>the game, detailed below. Additionally, this chapter introduces one character: Theo.</p>

        <p>coming from the mountain. It also introduces the player to a variety of new mechanics.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter6">
        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <p>Chapter 6: Reflection is the sixth chapter of Celeste. This chapter introduces Feathers which allow the player to fly for a</p>
        <p>short period of time, a new Badeline sequence and many more objects. It's also one of the most important chapters story-wise,</p>
        <p>telling a lot of information about the main protagonist.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter7">
        <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
        <p>Chapter 7: The Summit is the seventh chapter of Celeste. It's the final pre-Epilogue chapter which is a combination of mechanics</p>
        <p>from other chapters, however with the player's ability to double dash.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="epilogue">
        <h2>Epilogue</h2>
        <p>Epilogue is the chapter after Chapter 7: The Summit and plays after the credits. It's a small chapter consisting of a cutscene and</p>
        <p>the ending screen showing the player their deaths, strawberries and time.</p>
        <p>After the Epilogue ends, Chapter 8: Core is unlocked for the player, however they need 4 Crystal Hearts to access it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter8">
        <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
        <p>Chapter 8: Core is the eighth chapter of Celeste. This chapter introduces various new features, most notably: the inability to</p>
        <p>recharge dashes (without using a Diamond, or going through a screen transition), and the Crystal Heart Gate. The Crystal Heart Gate</p>
        <p>blocks the player from accessing the majority of Chapter 8: Core, until you have gotten 4 crystal hearts which you can find thought</p>
        <p>each of the chapters and from completing thier respective b and c sides.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter9">
        <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
        <p>Chapter 9: Farewell is the ninth and final chapter of Celeste, and was introduced as a free update to the game. The chapter introduces</p>
        <p>several new objects and utilizes highly technical mechanics, most notably, wavedashing and wall bouncing (see Moves). In spite of its</p>
        <p>lack of a B-Side or C-Side, Farewell is intended to be the longest and most challenging chapter of the game. It is unlocked when Chapter 8</p>
        <p>is completed, though depending on the player's progress, subchapters five and onward may be inaccessible as it requires you to get 15 crystal</p>
        <p>hearts in order to go though.</p>
